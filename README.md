This source code aims to derive route graphs for Indoor Navigation from 3d Topographic features of Buildings.

### Abstract

Over the past few years Personal Navigation Systems have become an established tool for route planning, but they are mainly designed for outdoor environments. Indoor navigation is still a challenging re- search area for several reasons: positioning is not very accurate, users can freely move between the interior boundaries of buildings, path network construction process may not be easy and straightforward due to complexity of indoor space configurations. Public buildings are getting bigger and more complex, so it is likely that even people who are familiar with these environments could possibly find diffi- cult to reach some specific room or place. The creation of a good net- work and data model is essential for deriving overall connectivity of a building and for representing position of objects within the environ- ment. Thus, the purpose of this research is the automatic derivation of the connectivity graph of a building for indoor navigation since from current literature it has not been found any approach that leads to automatic derivation of 2D and 3D Geometric Network models out of 3D digital models of complex buildings like CityGML or IFC

### Implementation details
The source code is built upon CGAL and therefore GPL applies to this project.
